# Bug Bounty tracker for Text as Data

This GitHub repo is used to track bug reports for the materials for the Text As Data course.

Please note that the exact scoring and rules may change during the semester (to deal with unexpected issues or types of bugs).

## Submission process

- Check that your issue hasn't already been reported by searching the issues on the [Issues](https://github.com/jakelever/textasdata_bugbounty/issues) page.
- Check the latest version of the slides, labs, etc (from the Moodle) in case it has been fixed
- Create an issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/jakelever/textasdata_bugbounty/issues) page
- Put in a useful title
- Put enough detail in the description to clearly describe what the `bug` is.
- You can describe multiple bugs in the same issue.
- Please be polite when reporting your issue and in any further discussions.
- After submission, I'll review it, decide the points and close it. It may take a few days to happen.

## Types of bugs

Bugs can be spelling mistakes, conceptual mistakes, coding mistakes in the lecture notes, labs, coursework, Moodle or anything else associated with the course.

## Judgements

About weekly, open issues will be reviewed and judgements made. You will only get points if you are the first to report it. Points will be based roughly on the table below.

| bug type   | points |

| spelling   |   1    |
| conceptual |   3-5  |
